  Traffic Light Plan

  HTML

  1. We have an outer container -> div

  2. Inner lights are going to be divs aswell

    2.1. A red, amber and a green light

  3. We need a button underneath with Click Me in

  CSS

  1. Lights are three different colours, all same size and shape (implies a class - let's call it traffic-light)

    1.1. We can have them all start transparent to make it easier

  2. Tackle different colours with IDs

  3. Container needs rounded corners and a background colour of black. There's padding too

  4. CSS is used to change the colours even though JS faciliates that change

  5. Class active so it sets the opacity to 1

  JS

  1. We need a function that on-click changes the class to active

  2. Need to track which light is the current light

    2.1. We need a variable to track the count
    2.2. list of lights ['red','yellow', 'green']

  3. Cycle through them

    3.1. modulus function make the cycle between 0 and 2

  4. We need to toggle (on/off) the active class. (If the class is on we need it off etc)

    4.1. Select the element we want and add or remove the class
